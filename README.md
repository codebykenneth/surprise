## 💌 Message

Mommy I love us more than words can ever describe 😌  

Every moment we share bisan simple ra fills my heart with happiness and peace. From our random talks, little jokes, cuddles, to tiny disagreements nga dali ra ta magkabalik, everything about us makes me feel like I am the luckiest person alive. Ikaw ra gyud akong perfect match, my safe place, my home, my everything. Every time I see your smile or hear your laugh, I fall in love with you all over again, deeper than before

I love how natural everything feels between us. We can be silly together, serious together, or just quietly enjoy each other’s presence, and it always feels right.  

I love how you care for me in ways nga dili pirmi visible, but I feel it deeply. I love your patience, your little surprises, your gentle words, and even your small jealous moments—everything about you makes me feel special and loved. With you, I feel understood, accepted, and truly seen. Ikaw ang akong best friend, akong partner, akong forever, and I am so grateful for every single moment with you

Us is my favorite thing in the world. I promise nga I will always care for us, protect our love, and choose you every single day. I will make you smile, wipe your tears, hug you tight when you feel lost, and celebrate every small and big victory with you.  

I will support you in your dreams, hold your hand through challenges, and always remind you nga ikaw akong everything. You make my life better mommy, and you inspire me to be a better person, to love harder, and to dream bigger

I love our little things—our inside jokes, the way we tease each other, the way we understand each other without saying a word, the way your hand fits perfectly in mine. I love the way we build memories together, even in the simplest moments. Every sunrise, every sunset, every laugh we share, every tear we wipe away together makes me realize nga ikaw ra gyud ang gusto nako kauban sa tibuok kinabuhi. Ikaw ang akong forever, ang akong home, ang akong heart, ang akong soul

I cannot wait to make more memories with you, to travel together, to dream together, to laugh, to hug, and to hold you close sa every sunrise and sunset. Every day with you is a blessing, and I am so grateful nga ikaw ang akong partner in this journey called life.  

Mommy I love us—our love, our bond, our story—and I promise nga I will never take it for granted. You and me, mommy, **us together**—I will always fight for us, I will always protect us, I will always love us with all my heart, all my soul, and all my life 🫶💖✨
